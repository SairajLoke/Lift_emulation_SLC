Door closes after timeout when no further requests exist.
Door opens at requested floor.
Door stays open when weight exceeds threshold.??

------------------Lift Movement-------------------
wrong direction key?....ignored till the first destination reached




----------Homing------------------------
System enters WAITING state on startup.
Lift transitions to IDLE when idle time exceeds threshold.
Homing behavior when no requests exist (idle returns to HOME_FLOOR).
Lift remains WAITING when no requests and doors are open.

-------------Request Handling-----------------
Valid request added to queue.
Queue is updated and next request is popped.
Queue emptied after serving all requests.
Redundant call is removed if floor already in queue.


-------- Concurrent Lift Calls ----------------
supports multiple concurrent lift calls. 
    - if they are on the way to the first call..the lift stops if the direction matches
    - if in different direction call the lift will put in queue but not stop while serving the first call,...will come back after serve is done


------- moving lift floor calls (from inside the lift)----------
Lift can be called from inside the lift while the lift is moving 
    - if the call is in the same direction as the lift, it will stop at the requested floor
    - if the call is in the opposite direction, it will be ignored ...as not valid direction, if no valid call for the entire dureation...close door and go waiting








so after 1st idle phase it goes into a waiting phase...with no more homing calls


Call at 4, and 
    call at 2 
        before it passes 2
        after it passes 2
